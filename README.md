My solution/attempt at the 17th project from the "Big Book Of Small Python Projects".
I used the blessed library for visuals, used sounds for the first time but there is no timer or point system.

How to use:
  1. Install blessed library https://pypi.org/project/blessed/
  2. Download the zip file from latest release https://github.com/greekvirus1/ascii-dice-math/releases/tag/v1.0.0https://github.com/greekvirus1/ascii-dice-math/releases/tag/v1.0.0
  3. Unzip folder somewhere
  4. Run 17-dice-math.py with Python through the terminal!
