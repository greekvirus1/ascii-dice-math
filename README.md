My solution/attempt at the 17th project from the "Big Book Of Small Python Projects".
I used the blessed library for visuals, used sounds for the first time but there is no timer or point system.
I am pretty happy with it except it looks a bit shite.

I decided to be more ambitious and make the game more fun by actually adding:
- Die ammount variance
- Timer
- Score
- Show top scores stored locally

Hopefully update soon!
